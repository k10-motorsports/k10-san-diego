"""Virtual drive test — simulate what a CAR experiences over the BUILT track, before any kn5.

The mesh audit checks geometry classes (vertices, surfaces, props). This drives the lap: six wheel
paths swept along the built triangles at 1 m steps, asking at every step the only three questions a
driver cares about:

  1. WHAT SURFACE IS UNDER THE TIRE?  The car rides the HIGHEST physical surface at (x,z). If that
     top surface is 1GRASS inside the lane, the ground pokes through the road — a launch. If the
     top surface steps more than a tire absorbs, it's a jolt. This is triangle-accurate: it samples
     the interpolated faces the physics engine collides with, not the vertices (which pass audits
     while the faces between them knife through — learned on the Lariat's switchbacks).
  2. IS ANYTHING STANDING IN THE CORRIDOR?  Walls, parapets, highway decks, posts, tree trunks —
     any triangle that rises above the deck inside the swept lane (+ margin) is an obstruction,
     reported by mesh name so the offender is identifiable (BARRIER_warning vs HWYSTRUCT vs TREES).
  3. IS THE SURFACE SMOOTH AT SPEED?  Wheel-path vertical kinks (slope change per metre) beyond
     what real roads allow. Real geometric design keeps cross-slope breaks under ~4-8% and rounds
     every grade change through vertical curves; a healthy build shows the same statistics.

Thresholds (physical rationale, tune at the top):
  STEP_BUMP_M    0.025  a 2.5 cm sharp step ~ hitting a lane reflector curb at speed — feel it
  STEP_SEVERE_M  0.060  6 cm ~ a full curb face — suspension crash, possible airborne moment
  KINK_PCT       3.0    slope change %-pts across 1 m ~ a driveway lip; real roads use vertical
                        curves precisely so this never happens on the carriageway
  OBST_CLEAR_M   0.25   anything rising this far above deck inside the corridor is a hit hazard

Run:  python -m scripts.geometry.drive_test tracks/<slug>
Writes data/drive_test.json, prints a per-problem report, exits 1 on FAIL (gate builds on it).
Pure stdlib; ~1-3 min for a 25 km lap.
