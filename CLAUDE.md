# k10-san-diego — Lake Murray Loop

A standalone repo for **one** Assetto Corsa track: a drivable loop around **Lake Murray**, San Diego
(Kevin's childhood neighborhood). Split out of the general `prodrive-ac-builder` so it can grow its own
way, with a different working method.

---

## The method (this is the important part)

> **Kevin is the designer. Claude is the Blender operator. We build it *live in Blender together*,
> shaping the real geometry by hand, and only export to kn5 once it's right.**

This is a deliberate pivot away from the old fully-headless "config → kn5 in one shot" pipeline. That
pipeline was good at *mapping the real world* but bad at *judgement calls* — it kept guessing wrong about
which roads, how the terrain should read, where things belong. So we're inverting it:

1. **Map the real loop** from OpenStreetMap + USGS elevation (headless, deterministic — the part the
   pipeline is good at). This is already done; the result is in `project/data/`.
2. **Import it into Blender** as editable meshes at real elevation (`scripts/blender/build_loop_blend.py`).
3. **Work on it live.** Kevin directs ("raise this crest", "tighten that kerb", "the bridge should…"),
   Claude operates Blender. The `.blend` is the source of truth from here on.
4. **Export to kn5 later**, once the geometry is right. (Not built yet — added when we get there.)

When operating Blender, **show, don't assert**: check the actual mesh/scene state before claiming
something; when Kevin says the real world is a certain way and the data disagrees, trust Kevin and fix the
data — he knows this neighborhood.

## Where we're starting

**Just the separated main loop** — nothing else. Five real roads, stitched into one closed ring:

```
Alvarado Rd → College Ave → Navajo Rd → Jackson Drive → Lake Murray Blvd / 70th → (close)
```

13.5 km, encircling the reservoir. No connectors, no buildings, no plants, no scenery. That all gets
added later, deliberately, in Blender.

---

## Lessons carried over (do NOT relearn these the hard way)

These were paid for in the old repo. They are baked into the data and the scripts here; keep them.

- **Roads and kerbs stay TIGHT to their real sampled elevation.** The road is the ground truth. Kerbs sit
  right on the road edge, not floating above or sunk below it.
- **Map the REAL roads.** The loop is routed along the actual OSM drivable network
  (`scripts/gps/street_route.py`), not traced or guessed. Divided roads pick one carriageway; a road whose
  name changes through an interchange (70th ⇄ Lake Murray Blvd over I-8) still connects on real pavement.
  Never invent a road (there is **no** "Cowles Mountain road" — that was a stitching error).
- **No fake mountains.** The raw USGS DEM carries real peaks (Cowles ~500 m) that tower over a
  neighborhood loop with none. The terrain is clamped to within **±`terrain.terrain_band_m`** (22 m) of
  the nearest road height, so distant peaks are cut to the road grade. *Roads keep their real elevation*
  — Jackson/Navajo genuinely climb the San Carlos hills (~213 m), Alvarado sits low by I-8 (~108 m).
- **Bridges are held LEVEL.** Bare-earth DEMs (3DEP) contain no bridge decks, so a road crossing a freeway
  samples the trench underneath and dips. `scripts/geometry/bridge_level.py` holds each real OSM bridge
  deck (College Ave, Lake Murray Blvd) level between its abutments. Run it AFTER projection, BEFORE mesh.
- **Interchange aliasing.** Where a flat road threads a freeway interchange, a coarse terrain grid can
  alias the road up into the embankment (70th St read a 57% cliff). Fix: sample that road's elevation
  directly from 3DEP at its own points, not the grid.
- **Units & axes.** Everything metric. The local frame is `x = east, y = up (elevation), z = north`
  (AC/kn5 is Y-up). The Blender importer remaps to Blender **Z-up** (`x, z, y`), +Y = north.

## The freeway NETWORK pipeline (ported from prodrive-ac-builder, 2026-07-20)

The Lake Murray loop stays Blender-first (above). The **freeway** is different: it's a branching graph
(both carriageways + every on/off ramp and interchange connector), so it uses the deterministic network
pipeline ported from prodrive-ac-builder — `project_freeway_net/` is its project:

```bash
./scripts/build_network.sh project_freeway_net          # full run (Overpass -> ... -> zip)
./scripts/build_network.sh project_freeway_net mesh     # offline resume from cached data (usual case)
```
Stages: `net` (Overpass motorway+motorway_link, mainlines ref-filtered so I-805 stays out) → `classify`
→ `elev` (3DEP) → `mesh` (build_network_mesh: ribbons per edge, OSM-layer flyover decks, viaduct piers
with clear-span suppression, concrete walls, median fill) → **audit gate** (`audit_mesh`: A supports-in-
road and B terrain-poke must be 0 or the build stops) → `env` → `blend`/`kn5`/`pack` (Blender 4.2).
Piers are suppressed using the audit's own band (y_top−45 … y_top−1.5) with a ±3-cell scan — the fix
that cleared 6 downtown piers standing in I-5. `project_freeway/` (single-ribbon layout) is the retired
predecessor — the shipped track uses the network freeway, merged into the loop (below).

## The ONE combined "K10 - San Diego" kn5 (loop + freeway, `scripts/build_combined.sh`)

The shipped track is a SINGLE kn5 containing both the Lake Murray loop AND the freeway network, at their
real relative position (~12 km apart — "connect them eventually"). Build it with one command:
```bash
scripts/build_combined.sh           # merge the current freeway build into the loop -> combined kn5 + zip
scripts/build_combined.sh freeway   # rebuild the freeway (mesh+env, unmirrored) first, then merge
```
How the merge works — the loop stays Blender-first, the freeway is a build INPUT:
- The freeway network MUST be built `mirror_x=false` (matching the loop's frame). `scripts/ac/merge_freeway.py`
  translates its `track.obj` + `environment.obj` into the loop's local frame (origin delta + elevation-datum
  delta), suffixing group names `_fw` (keeping the 1ROAD_/1GRASS_/1WALL_/HWYSTRUCT prefix).
- The loop's `build_kn5.py` imports those OBJs with the SAME `(x,z,y)`-reflect remap `make_mesh` uses, so
  they land in the loop frame and the existing rename/face-up-flip/PBR pass handles them. Walls + HWYSTRUCT
  are double-sided (the reflection flips their winding; a barrier must collide from both sides).
- One layout (`full`) = the whole thing. Ships as one zip via GitHub Releases.

**Lake Murray extras** (both feed the loop via `scripts/geometry/extra_lines.py` → `connectors.local.json`):
the **Del Cerro sub-loop** (Del Cerro Blvd/Ave, Airoso, Adelante, Colorado, Connecticut, Wisconsin —
`route.connectors`) and **per-direction carriageways** on divided roads (`route.split_carriageways`,
e.g. Navajo/College): the opposing carriageway is pulled from OSM, sampled at its OWN real 3DEP, and added
beside the loop where the two are cleanly divided; the main loop is narrowed to one carriageway there. Each
extra line carries real point-precise 3DEP (the sub-loop climbs the Del Cerro hill; College keeps its real
~6 m per-direction split).

## kn5 export (installable AC track)

`loop.blend` is the source of truth; the kn5 pipeline **consumes** it — so hand-edits ship. One command:
```bash
scripts/build_kn5.sh project     # -> project/build/<slug>_track.zip (drop into Content Manager)
```
Stages: `build_kn5.py` opens loop.blend, renames the working meshes to AC conventions
(ROAD→`1ROAD_road`, TERRAIN→`1GRASS`, KERB→`1KERB_kerb`, GUARDRAIL→`1WALL_guard`), adds tiling UVs + PBR
materials + the AC_START/PIT/TIME/HOTLAP dummies, welds the grass watertight, and **flips drivable faces
up** (the local→Blender axis remap is a reflection that inverts winding — face-down = car falls through;
fix deterministically by reversing only normal.z<0 faces, never `recalc_face_normals`). Then
`export_kn5_addon.py` runs the vendored addon (Blender **4.2** — not 5) to write the kn5, `verify_kn5`
gates it (no dup meshes, drivable face-up, under the 65 k cap, spawns on road), and `track_folder`
writes surfaces.ini / ui / map / models.ini / CSP ext_config. Ships via GitHub Releases, not git.

## Commands

**Build the Blender scene from the mapped loop** (resets base geometry — run when you want a fresh start):
```bash
BL="$HOME/.cache/prodrive-ac-builder/Blender4.2.9.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender"
"$BL" --background --python scripts/blender/build_loop_blend.py -- project
```
Then open `project/loop.blend` in the Blender GUI. **Once we start hand-editing, that `.blend` is the
truth — don't regenerate it without meaning to.**

**Re-map the loop from real roads** (only if the route/roads change) — offline, from the cached network:
```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json
from scripts.gps import overpass, centerline
from scripts.trace import osm
from collections import defaultdict
cache = json.load(open('project/data/network.cache.json'))
byname = defaultdict(list)
for w in cache:
    if w.get('name'): byname[w['name']].append([(x[0], x[1]) for x in w['geom']])
overpass.fetch_ways   = lambda bbox, names, **k: {n: byname.get(n, []) for n in names}
osm.fetch_drivable    = lambda bbox, **k: [{"geom": [(x[0], x[1]) for x in w['geom']]} for w in cache]
print(centerline.build_centerline('project')[1])
PY
# then: elevation (heightfield) → projection → bridge_level → rebuild the .blend
```

## Build environment

- **Mac** (this machine): all geometry + Blender work. Blender **4.2.9** at
  `$HOME/.cache/prodrive-ac-builder/Blender4.2.9.app`. System `python3` (stdlib only — no numpy needed;
  the `.npy` reader is hand-rolled).
- **Windows**: only for the eventual in-game drive/QA once we're exporting kn5.
